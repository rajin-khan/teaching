### **Scenario-Based Question (Example 1)**  (12)
A charity organization is creating a software system to manage donations and send thank-you messages to donors.

Write a pseudocode algorithm that:
- Inputs the names and donation amounts for 100 donors.
- Stores the donor names and amounts in parallel arrays.
- Calculates the total donation amount.
- Outputs the name(s) of the donor(s) who donated the highest amount and the total amount donated.

You may assume that:
- All donations are positive real numbers.
- No two donors have the same name.
