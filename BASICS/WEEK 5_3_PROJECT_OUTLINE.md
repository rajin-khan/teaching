WEEK 5_3 (PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS)

## Project Outline: Management System in C Using Text Files as a Database

### Project Overview
Create a management system in C that showcases CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and search functionality using text files as a database. The project should demonstrate clean and readable code with proper usage of functions. The development process will be documented via GitHub with a well-maintained README file and appropriate commit messages. The final submission will include a single `.c` file, a `.txt` file as the database, and a report PDF. The project checklist markdown file must be cloned into the project repo and updated accordingly.

### Project Structure
1. **Project Setup**
   - Create a GitHub repository for the project.
   - Set up the project structure with initial files:
     - `main.c`
     - `database.txt`
     - `README.md`
     - `report.pdf`

2. **Functionality Implementation**
   - **Create Operation**
     - Implement a function to add new records to the database.
   - **Read Operation**
     - Implement a function to display all records from the database.
   - **Update Operation**
     - Implement a function to modify existing records in the database.
   - **Delete Operation**
     - Implement a function to remove records from the database.
   - **Search Functionality**
     - Implement a function to search for records based on specific criteria.

3. **File Handling**
   - Use file I/O functions to read from and write to the text file.
   - Ensure proper opening and closing of files.
   - Handle potential file-related errors.

4. **Code Readability and Organization**
   - Use functions to modularize the code.
   - Follow camelCase naming convention for variables and functions.
   - Ensure code is properly indented and commented.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Implement error handling for user inputs and file operations.

6. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - **GitHub Usage**
     - Regular commits with meaningful messages in the format: "Added/Updated *featureName*/changes".
     - Maintain a comprehensive `README.md` file.
     - Update the `PROJECT_CHECKLIST.md` file regularly.
   - **Report PDF**
     - Detailed explanation of each part of the code.
     - Include pictures and a logo.
     - Use tools like Canva for design.
     - Summarize project features and implementation details.
