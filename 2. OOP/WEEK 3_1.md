### WEEK 3_1: Practice Questions on Java Programming Concepts

1. **Basic Variable Declaration**
   - Write a Java program that declares two integer variables, assigns values to them, and prints their sum.

2. **Simple If-Else Statement**
   - Create a program that takes an integer input from the user and checks if the number is positive, negative, or zero. Print an appropriate message based on the result.

3. **Switch Statement**
   - Write a program that takes an integer input representing a month (1-12) and prints the corresponding month name (e.g., 1 = January, 2 = February, etc.) using a switch statement.

4. **For Loop**
   - Write a program that uses a for loop to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.

5. **While Loop**
   - Create a program that uses a while loop to print all the odd numbers between 1 and 20.

6. **Do-While Loop**
   - Write a program that prompts the user for a number and continues to print that number until the user enters zero, using a do-while loop.

7. **String Length and Concatenation**
   - Create a program that takes two strings from the user, prints the length of each string, and also prints the concatenated result.

8. **String Methods**
   - Write a program that takes a sentence from the user and prints the number of characters (excluding spaces) in that sentence.

9. **Class Definition and Object Instantiation**
   - Define a class called `Person` with attributes for name and age. Create a constructor to initialize these attributes, and write a method to display the person's details. Instantiate an object of this class and call the method.

10. **Setters and Getters**
    - Modify the `Person` class to include setter and getter methods for the age attribute. Create an object, set the age using the setter, and retrieve it using the getter. Print the retrieved age.

11. **Using Conditional Statements**
    - Write a program that prompts the user for a grade percentage (0-100) and uses conditional statements to determine and print the corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, D, F).

12. **Nested If Statements**
    - Create a program that prompts the user for their age and uses nested if statements to check if they are a child (0-12), teenager (13-19), or adult (20+). Print the appropriate category.

13. **For Loop with Array**
    - Write a program that initializes an array of five integers, uses a for loop to calculate the sum of the array elements, and prints the result.

14. **String Comparison**
    - Create a program that takes two strings from the user and compares them for equality. Print whether the strings are equal or not using the `equals()` method.

15. **Using Getters and Setters with Class**
    - Define a class called `Car` with attributes for model and year. Implement getter and setter methods for both attributes. Create an object of `Car`, set its model and year, and print the values using getters.

### Instructions for Submission
- Create java project folder called CW1 where all the answers will be written.
- Name each file as the question number in words, for example question 1's answer file would be named "Qone.java", and question 2's would be 'Qtwo.java", name any other class files as required and as you wish.
- Solve each question and write your code in your Java IDE.
- Ensure that your code follows proper naming conventions (such as capitalizing class names, file names, and following the camelCaseConvention) and is well-formatted.
- Test your code to verify its functionality before submission.
