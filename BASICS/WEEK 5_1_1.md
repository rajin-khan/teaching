WEEK 5_1_1 (pointer questions)

## Practice Problems on Pointers in C

### Problem 1: Declaring and Initializing a Pointer
Write a C program to declare an integer variable and a pointer to this variable. Initialize the variable, assign its address to the pointer, and print the value of the variable using the pointer.

### Problem 2: Pointer Arithmetic
Write a C program to declare an integer array, assign the address of the first element to a pointer, and use the pointer to print all elements of the array.

### Problem 3: Swapping Two Numbers Using Pointers
Write a C program to swap the values of two integer variables using pointers.

### Problem 4: Pointer to Pointer
Write a C program to declare a pointer to a pointer, assign the address of a pointer to it, and print the value of the original variable using the pointer to pointer.

### Problem 5: Passing Pointers to Functions
Write a C program to calculate the sum of two numbers using a function that takes pointers as arguments.


### Problem 6: Pointer to Array
Write a C program to declare a pointer to an array, assign the address of an array to it, and print all elements of the array using the pointer.

### Problem 7: Character Pointers
Write a C program to declare a character pointer, assign a string to it, and print the string using the pointer.
